**Exercise**

1. Using faceting, find out how many different interview_date values there are in the survey results.
1. Is the column formatted as Text or Date?
1. Use faceting to produce a timeline display for interview_date. You will need to use Edit cells > Common transforms > To date to convert this column to dates.
1. During what period were most of the interviews collected?

<details>
<summary>
Solution
</summary>
For the column interview_date do Facet > Text facet. 

A box will appear in the left panel showing that there are 19 unique entries in this column. 

By default, the column interview_date is formatted as Text. 

You can change the format by doing Edit cells > Common transforms > To date.

Notice the the values in the column turn green. Doing Facet > Timeline facet creates a box in the left panel that shows a histogram of the number of entries for each date.


Most of the data was collected in November of 2016.
